- testsuite!

- libtool features (requires configure.ac)
    - option-parser
    - bootstrap
    - funclib.sh
        - ${1+"$@"} does not work in zsh, funclib.sh fixes that

- add --with-koji-build=ID option
    - this should create temporary directory, download packages into it, run
      createrepo/createrepo_c and add repo file

- introduce 'DTF_BETA=' env variable -- beta API methods would fail if this
  variable is empty/undefined.

- dtf_fail_hooks off/on option
